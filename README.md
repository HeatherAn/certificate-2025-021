This repository is a clone of the author's Github repository associated with the publication.

## Summary

Figures 1 and 3 are exemplifying pictures of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used and the wind tunnel experiment setup. Those figures can be found in the `./photos/` directory of the code repository. All other 5 figures of the publication can be reproduced using the MATLAB scripts found in the `./src/` directory. These scripts also generate the `.mat` files found in `./models/`. Only the positioning of the legend is slightly different for some of the figures which can occur due to different DPI settings of the systems and the MATLAB version with which the figures were rendered. Playing with the legend positioning allows to reproduce their positioning in the original  figures. 

## Preparation steps

The code scripts were developed and tested by the authors in MATLAB R2024a. The codechecker has reviewed the code scripts in MATLAB R2025a, run in both Windows 11 and MacOS Sequoia 15.4.1. 

No extra MATLAB modules are required (other than the ones installed by default). 

It is important to mention the scripts use Blade Element Momentum (BEM) simulation data. The authors provide the data they used in the code repository itself (this is what was used for the CODECHECK as well). It does give others the opportunity to use different BEM data for which the use of the BEM tool [CCBlade](https://github.com/WISDEM/CCBlade) is recommended. 

See more information in the (README)[https://github.com/tudelft/propeller_airspeed_sensor/blob/main/README.md] of the code repository. 

## Reproducing Results

Paths to files were modified accordingly (at the top of the scripts).

In the original code repository, the scripts display the figures within MATLAB itself and generate output to the MATLAB command window. The scripts do not save the figures to files, but the authors do provide the figures in `.fig` and `.pdf` format in the `./figs` and `./pdf/` directories, respectively. 

For reproducibility purposes, the codechecker deleted the provided figures and added the printing instructions to the scripts to save the figures from scratch. Thus the files found in the `./figs` and `./pdf/` directories correspond to the figures generated by the codechecker during the reviewing process using MATLAB R2025a in MacOS Sequoia 15.4.1. 


### Default outputs

When running the scripts with the default values, the scripts generate output to the MATLAB command window. This output is now provided in the (README)[https://github.com/tudelft/propeller_airspeed_sensor/blob/main/README.md] of the code repository.

The printed figures can be found in the `./pdf/` directory of this repository. As mentioned above, the codechecker added the printing instructions to the scripts (see commit history of this repository). This results in a different positioning of the legend in some of the figures, compared to the figures presented in the related publication. However this can be easily adjusted, and it is only the positioning of the legend, not the content of it nor the content nor labels of the plot itself. As mentioned above the figures were also reproduced by the codechecker in MATLAB R2025a in Windows 11, for which the default DPI settings also move the legend's position in some of the figures.
